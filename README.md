# Heart Disease Prediction System ❤️
This project is a Machine Learning web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on medical clinical parameters. It uses a Decision Tree Classifier for the backend logic and Streamlit for the frontend user interface.

## 🚀 Live Demo :- https://heart-disease-nq03.onrender.com/

## 📊 Dataset Features
The model analyzes 13 key health indicators from the heart.csv file:

Age

Sex (Gender)

CP (Chest Pain Type)

Trestbps (Resting Blood Pressure)

Chol (Serum Cholesterol)

Fbs (Fasting Blood Sugar)

Restecg (Resting ECG results)

Thalach (Maximum Heart Rate achieved)

Exang (Exercise Induced Angina)

Oldpeak (ST depression)

Slope (Slope of peak exercise ST segment)



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (Decision Tree)

Frontend: Streamlit

Model Storage: Pickle

Deployment: Render / GitHub
Ca (Number of major vessels)

Thal (Thalassemia)
